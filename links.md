Malware, short for “malicious software,” refers to any intrusive software developed by cybercriminals (often called “hackers”) to steal data and damage or destroy computers and computer systems. Examples of common malware include viruses, worms, Trojan viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware. Recent malware attacks have exfiltrated data in mass amounts.

# Week 3

## 1. [10 Commands to Check Disk Partitions and Disk Space on Linux](https://www.binarytides.com/linux-command-check-disk-partitions/)<br>

In this post we are taking a look at some commands that can be used to check up the partitions on your system. The commands would check what partitions there are on each disk and other details like the total size, used up space and file system etc. Commands like fdisk, sfdisk and cfdisk are general partitioning tools that can not only display the partition information, but also modify them.

## 2. [Working with tarballs on Linux](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3328840/working-with-tarballs-on-linux.html)<br>

Tarballs provide a versatile way to back up and manage groups of files on Linux systems. Follow these tips to learn how to create them, as well as extract and remove individual files from them.

## 3. [What Are Some Reasons You Would Use Disk Partitioning](https://ostoday.org/linux/what-are-some-reasons-you-would-use-disk-partitioning-before-installing-linux.html)<br>

Partitioning a disk can make it easier to organize files, such as video and photo libraries, especially if you have a large hard drive. Creating a separate partition for your system files (the startup disk) can also help protect system data from corruption since each partition has its own file system.

## 4. [What Is NFS? Understanding the Network File System](https://www.atera.com/blog/what-is-nfs-understanding-the-network-file-system/)<br>

A Network File System or NFS is necessary for helping your business share files over a network. An NFS is a protocol that lets users on client computers access files on a network. You can access remote data and files from anything that links to the network you will use. All people within a network will have access to the same files, making file-sharing efforts easier.

# Week 4

## 1. [Clear RAM Memory Cache, Buffer and Swap Space](https://www.tecmint.com/clear-ram-memory-cache-buffer-and-swap-space-on-linux/)<br>

Like any other operating system, GNU/Linux has implemented memory management efficiently and even more than that. But if any process is eating away your memory and you want to clear it, Linux provides a way to flush or clear ram cache.

## 2. [Memory Utilization in Linux](https://www.tothenew.com/blog/understanding-memory-utilization-in-linux/)<br>

inux is an awesome operating system. It performs good with fewer resources and tries to maximize utilization of available resources automatically and because of this, it’s slightly difficult to understand resource utilization.

## 3. [Find Out the Total Physical Memory (RAM) on Linux](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/total-physical-memory)<br>

ometimes, we might need to check for total memory size on a server running Linux or we might need to use memory stats in shell scripts. Fortunately, we have access to numerous tools that we can use to check for total physical memory. In this tutorial, we’re going to take different approaches to serve that purpose by using several useful commands and tools.

## 4. [Free vs. Available Memory in Linux](https://haydenjames.io/free-vs-available-memory-in-linux/)<br>

At times we will need to know precisely how our Linux systems use memory. This article will examine how to use the free command-line utility to view memory usage on a Linux system. In doing so, we will clearly define the difference between free vs. available memory on Linux systems.

## 5. [How to Use Pointers in C](https://linuxhint.com/use-pointers-c/)<br>

In C, learning pointers is simple and enjoyable. Certain Programming language activities are easier to complete with pointers, while others, like dynamic memory allocation, seem impossible to complete without them. To be a competent C developer, it is thus beneficial to understand pointers. Within C, a pointer is a variable that holds the location of some other variable.

## 6. [C development on Linux](https://linuxconfig.org/c-development-on-linux-pointers-and-arrays-vi)<br>

You probably know that operating systems deal with addresses when storing values, just as you would label things inside a warehouse so you have an easy way of finding them when needed. On the other hand, an array can be defined as a collection of items identified by indexes. You will see later why pointers and arrays are usually presented together, and how to become efficient in C using them.

## 7. [What Is Little-Endian And Big-Endian Byte Ordering?](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/what-is-little-endian-and-big-endian/)<br>

Computers store data in memory in binary. One thing that is often overlooked is the formatting at the byte level of this data. This is called endianness and it refers to the ordering of the bytes. Specifically, little-endian is when the least significant bytes are stored before the more significant bytes, and big-endian is when the most significant bytes are stored before the less significant bytes.

## 8. [How is Virtual Memory Translated to Physical Memory?](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/03/how-is-virtual-memory-translated-to-physical-memory.html)<br>

Memory is one of the most important host resources. For workloads to access global system memory, we need to make sure virtual memory addresses are mapped to the physical addresses. There are several components working together to perform these translations as efficient as possible. This blog post will cover the basics on how virtual memory addresses are translated.

# Week 5

## 1. [Demand Paging in OS](https://digitalthinkerhelp.com/demand-paging-in-os-operating-system-examples-advantages-working/)<br>

Demand paging is a process of swapping in the Virtual Memory system. In this process, all data is not moved from hard drive to main memory because while using this demand paging, when some programs are getting demand then data will be transferred.

## 2. [Virtual and Physical Addresses](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/F06/slides/cs350_D.pdf)<br>

Physical addresses are provided by the hardware, Virtual (or logical) addresses are provided by the OS kernel. OS divides physical memory into partitions. Different partitions can have different sizes

## 3. [What is virtual memory?](https://techmonitor.ai/what-is/what-is-virtual-memory-4929986)<br>

Virtual memory is a feature of an operating system that enables a computer to be able to compensate shortages of physical memory by transferring pages of data from random access memory to disk storage. This process is done temporarily and is designed to work as a combination of RAM and space on the hard disk. This means that when RAM runs low, virtual memory can move data from it to a space called a paging file. This process allows for RAM to be freed up so that a computer can complete the task.

## 4. [How Big Should Your Page File or Swap Partition Be?](https://www.howtogeek.com/196238/how-big-should-your-page-file-or-swap-partition-be/)<br>

According to an old rule of thumb, your page file or swap should be “double your RAM” or “1.5x your RAM.” But do you really need a 32 GB page file or swap if you have 16 GB of RAM?. You probably don’t need that much page file or swap space, which is a relief considering a modern computer might have a solid-state drive with very little space.

## 5. [How to create and activate a paging file on the Linux command line](https://www.tremplin-numerique.org/en/how-to-create-and-activate-a-exchange-file-on-the-linux-command-line)<br>

As you learn what a sawp file is and does, you will learn how to create and activate one on your Linux instance. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to ensure that your system will no longer run out of memory.

## 6. [What are the Page Replacement Algorithms?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-the-page-replacement-algorithms)<br>

This lesson will introduce you to the concept of page replacement, which is used in memory management. You will understand the definition, need and various algorithms related to page replacement. A computer system has a limited amount of memory. Adding more memory physically is very costly. Therefore most modern computers use a combination of both hardware and software to allow the computer to address more memory than the amount physically present on the system. This extra memory is actually called Virtual Memory.
